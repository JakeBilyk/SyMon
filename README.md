Hello Team,

This project was written by Jake Bilyk and GPT-4o.  It was inspired by the symbrosia-co/Symbrosia-Controller author Andrew Cooper (https://github.com/symbrosia-co/Symbrosia-Controller).

For continued work on this project the most relevant files are:

/backend/server.js
/frontend/src/App.js
/frontend/src/components/Dashboard.js

and any other pages that will be added, likely to the components folder or a refractored App.js

When making any adjustments to the frontend, remember to run an npm build and copy the build folder files to
the backend build folder.  This is a step I always forget when debugging new features.
